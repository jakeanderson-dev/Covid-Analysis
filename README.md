# COVID-19 Data Visualization

This project analyzes and visualizes COVID-19 trends in the United States, focusing on new cases and total cases over time. The analysis uses data from *Our World in Data* and provides insights into the evolution of the pandemic.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: The COVID-19 data used in this project comes from the [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) repository.
- **Objective**: To visualize COVID-19 trends in the U.S. through two key metrics:
  - **New Cases**: The number of new COVID-19 cases reported on each day.
  - **Total Cases**: The cumulative number of cases over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced visual styling (optional).
- **FuncFormatter**: For custom y-axis formatting.

## Setup Instructions

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-data-visualization.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd covid-data-visualization
   
4. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

6. Run the Python script:
   python covid_analysis.py
   
This will generate the visualizations as PNG files and save them to the project directory.

Visualizations
Here are the visualizations generated by the project:

1. New COVID-19 Cases Over Time

This plot shows the number of new COVID-19 cases reported over time in the United States.

2. Total COVID-19 Cases Over Time

![total_cases_plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10be630-7e2e-4ee6-a479-0b9058d97fd9)

This plot shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases over time in the United States.

Insights
The plots show the exponential growth of new cases during early waves of the pandemic.
The total cases graph provides an overview of how the pandemic accumulated over time in the U.S.
